# My C++ and JavaScript Practice Repository

This repository contains all the code files I have practiced while learning C++ and JavaScript. Each file is a small program or a script that demonstrates various concepts in programming. Below is a brief description of the files included in this repository:

## C++ Files

### Basics and Functions
- **constructur and average.cpp**: Demonstrates the use of constructors and calculates the average.
- **constructor with parameters by chat gpt corrected.cpp**: Example of a constructor with parameters.
- **counting upto 1 lake.cpp**: A program that counts up to 100,000.
- **creating table using function.cpp**: Generates a multiplication table using a function.
- **friend function practise.cpp**: Practices using friend functions in C++.
- **hands on practise on class, accessors.cpp**: Example of using classes and accessors.
- **huffy.cpp**: Demonstrates Huffman coding technique.
- **inheritance first program.cpp**: Introduction to inheritance in C++.
- **marks111.cpp**: Calculates and displays marks.

### Advanced Concepts
- **multi_level_inheritance by chat gpt.cpp**: Example of multi-level inheritance.
- **multi_level_inheritance.cpp**: Another implementation of multi-level inheritance.
- **nested loop for pattern.cpp**: Uses nested loops to create a pattern.
- **prime no by cht gpt.cpp**: Determines if a number is prime.
- **prime number cheking.cpp**: Another approach to checking for prime numbers.
- **prime numbers using continue statement.cpp**: Prime number program utilizing the continue statement.
- **showing sum and squares exemple 7.7.cpp**: Displays the sum and square of numbers.

### Arrays and Patterns
- **sorting of array.cpp**: Demonstrates array sorting.
- **star.cpp**: Prints a star pattern using loops.
- **successor and predecessor.cpp**: Finds the successor and predecessor of a number.
- **sum of two nubers.cpp**: Adds two numbers.
- **sum.cpp**: Basic program for summing numbers.

### Other Files
- **script.js**: JavaScript code for a specific function or task.
- **Two Sum.cpp**: Solves the Two Sum problem.
- **Friend class prctise.cpp**: Practices friend class in C++.
- **Testing public and privat accessors.cpp**: Tests public and private accessors in a class.
- **array using defining function out of class.cpp**: Demonstrates array operations with functions defined outside of the class.
- **bcss.cpp**: Contains code for a specific problem or concept in C++.
- **constructor and destructor.cpp**: Illustrates the use of constructors and destructors.

## Usage

Each file can be executed separately to understand the specific concept being demonstrated. Some files are simple examples of basic programming constructs, while others involve more complex concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, friend functions, and advanced data structures.
